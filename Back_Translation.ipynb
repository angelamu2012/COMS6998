The one that was exposed (likely this past Thursday) I have not seen in person since Wednesday. However, he was in the office Friday while I was not. The one that was exposed is working from home today and the next several. Has anyone else encountered this type of situation and if so what did you do? My sanity doesnt want me to work from home again but my fear and anxiety are slowly taking back over. Any suggestions on what to do? For reference, by the way, our branch is a very small group.

That feels better to say that.... 6 months ago we decided to rent a house (VRBO) at the beach for a getaway. There's no boardwalk and the beach isn't packed. It's a family atmosphere. It's just me and my wife and 2 kids. My wife and I are fully vaccinated. 1 kid just got the 2nd shot and the other is too young to get vaccinated. We aren't planning any activities beyond sitting on the beach and enjoying time away from home. We still aren't dining in at restaurants and we wear masks indoors. I'm not too concerned about the beach since it is outdoors and we can maintain more than 6' of distance from everyone. I can't shake a fear about the rental house. I don't know who was in it before us. In theory, they are leaving at 11am, a cleaning crew will come in, then we can arrive at 4. That's a lot of presumably unmasked people in a space that I'm about to inhabit. It's probably irrational, but I don't want to sit on the couch, or use dishes, etc... I'm scared of the air conditioning. I know that sounds silly. We are planning to wash the sheets and towels when we get there since 1 kid is allergic to a few detergents. I see the numbers, usually a percentage, and I don't understand them. It's hard for me to interpret. I never see it as odds like 1 out of every so many people will get delta. I know a few people that are vaccinated that still got Delta, I read about it every day. I don't really understand what the chances are that we catch it. I really want to relax in the house, but I am freaked out. I've spent 18 months in a bubble in my house and I don't know how to get out of it. I know this seems silly. I'm embarrassed to feel this way. I want to get away and create fun memories with my wife and kids. What are the real risks of the rental house and what can I do to mitigate them?\"\n",

Even the two guys that shared a hotel room with him were negative. And no one even got sick, no one had as little as a headache. I don't understand. I still disinfect groceries. I still wear a mask even outdoors. I lost a dear person to this evil virus. I read people being careful and getting it. And yet 20 people in a room with a symptomatic person resulted in 0 infections.

I lost pretty much my entire mid 20s to this pandemic, and just when things were starting to get better, a new variant had to show up and it got to the point that even us vaccinated people are not 100% safe. During the time that it seemed safe, I planned a surprise dinner for my sisters 23rd birthday, but now Im wondering if I should cancel (cuz the reservations are for indoors, and at this point itll be hard to find anything else). SoI wonder it safe to go to restaurants (especially ones that are popping) and eat indoors if everyone in your party and yourself are vaccinated? Im young as well (in my mid 20s) and everyone is also around the 23-26 range. All the people I live with are also vaccinated, and same with anyone who would be in our party (tho some of us are still with parents).

Yesterday we had a big argument because I suggested that we should do those quick self tests just to feel a little bit more safe. They are all vaccinated, but me being only 24 did not have the chance to get it yet (this is Portugal by the way, I know in the US for instance I could already get my vaccine). Anyway, they basically disagree said that they are safe now so they would not have any care, and go out and won't get tested. I've tried to reason explaining that I am still unvaccinated amd therefore at higher risk than them, and would be more comfortable of we still were a bit careful. I am not asking them to get tested every day, I plan to test myself very 4 days or so but would be fine if they did it once a week or so (doing what 2 tests in total while I am there). I'm feeling terrified, they say that I am being selfish for trying to impose some rules, but I am just trying to protect myself, I am absolutely terrified of getting Covid, and have been able to resist all this time and want to continue to do so. What do you advise me to do? What can I do to protect myself from my family? I plan to wear my mask in common spaces even though I know it annoys them, and maybe trying to prepare my food separately when they are not around.

The short version is that my partner and I are both fully vaxxed but also both \\\"high risk\\\". Before Delta showed up in the US we booked a trip to a Florida beach with our also vaxxed but not high risk friends. At the time I had no concerns about the trip at all. But now I'm looking at the news in Florida and am starting to have concerns about the trip. We'd be going a few weeks after schools opened and it looks like hospitals are already filling. My partner works (fully masked) with the public, so I know we could already catch Delta at any time, but I am worried about catching it a 14 hour drive from home and in a place with very limited medical support. We also have very limited funds and really couldn't afford to extend our stay in the case that we got too sick to make the drive back up. We also really can't afford to have my partner take a week off from work and then take off another 10 days if we ended up exposed. I don't want to disappoint my friends though who already asked weeks ago to promise that we would go on the trip no matter what happened with Delta. I know that isn't a good reason to do something, but I am wondering if I'm being overly cautious and ruining a trip for three people unnecessarily. I know breakthroughs are relatively rare, but I already know half a dozen people at work who had them and their symptoms were way more in line with \\\"flu\\\" than \\\"sniffles\\\". Again, I know that we still need to live our lives and the vaccines are extremely protective, but since we are high risk, low funds, and would be so far from home, I'm worried about what would happen if we were to get sick down there. Does anyone have any input on if this is relatively safe or a bad idea? The beach itself is more residential and fairly remote from what I can tell. Thank you!\"\n",

Fast forward now and i am completely different thankfully. Although I gotta say there are still quite some things that I wish I could let go. One of those is showering. I take a whole hr washing every body part for like 20 seconds multiple times. On top of that I constantly wash my hands repeatedly after touching a dirty part of my body that hasnt been cleaned yet. This also because I go to the gym so I psych myself out. I always end my showers with cleaning the inside of the shower including the handles as a just in case as well. Even when I come home I take my clothes off then proceed to spray alcohol where I took them off. I really wanna stop. I know transmission through touch is very rare but my OCD is getting to me still.

I'm totally vaccinated now so I'm coming home for a week to visit, and she's talking about all these bars she wants to go and all these activities she wants to do (where there'll probably be a lot of other unmasked, unvaccinated people). I just don't know what to do. She's been pretty reckless throughout the covid (which goes to the dates, just wearing a mask if she absolutely had to do it, etc.) and I've been really worried about her safety, and especially now with the new variants and the fact that she has the free reign to return to normal. I don't know what to do.\"\n",

The following day after my second dose, I woke up with a sore arm, very warm and almost fever like feeling (but not actual fever just very warm body temperature), and of course a really bad headache. I was out and unable to do just about anything for a day and fortunately, it was on a weekend (the day after I got my 2nd dose), and after one day, my headache was much more manageable and wasn't as debilitating as the previous day. Personally (speaking for myself and maybe others as well), I would do it all again if it means to put the pandemic in the past and also to get continued immunity against Covid19 as well as the variants. I'll even take the booster shots and go through the suffering if it means that I can live a normal, pre-covid life again.

We can only snack in our rooms or distanced in the mess hall (even there we have to mask up as soon as we finish).

My BF's cousin invited me to drink at his house. In total there would be four people (me, my bf, his cousin and his girlfriend). Everyone is fully vaccinated. Up until now, I have only stood in front of people with my FFP2 mask. I try to be less worried but I don't really have the guts to take it off unless I'm outside and no one's in sight.. I've met my BF a couple of times outside after I got my second shot but we both kept our masks on at all times. So, I really want to ask if it is safe to see people without masks when everyone is fully vaccinated. I am 23F and I have asthma and rheumatoid Arthritis.

(Everyone else is my family is vaccinated too btw) I live with her, so if I do catch COVID despite being vaccinated, I am afraid I would pass it onto her. Alternatively, I also thought about isolating myself for some time after my hangout. I would be fine wearing a mask around my family for 1-2 weeks. I get tested regularly anyways (once a week) so there's that, too. Sorry if this seems paranoid, I just wanna be on the safe side. But I also get so depressed not having seen anyone for so long.\"\n",

Now I'm totally vaccinated with Biontech (I have my second chance at 24.07) and I want to go through with friends again. My BF's cousin invited me to drink in her house. In total there would be four people (I, my bf, her cousin and her girlfriend). Everyone is totally vaccinated. So far, I've only been in front of people with my FFP2 mask so they get vaccinated. I try to be less concerned, but I don't have the guts to take it off unless I'm out and no one is in sight. I've met my family a couple of times out after they gave me my second chance, but we're both going to get caught with that mask at all times.

I had worked from home long before the world was away and my wife has been a stay at home mom for our 4 years since birth. We are very many domestic bodies, so the blockades and such were not a huge exit from the life we had been carrying before. Everything has changed with the school year coming fast. We initially planned to send our daughter to Pre-K last year but we chose not because of our concerns about the virus. On an October birthday she will be one of the older children in class this year and is severely delayed by the kind of social interaction that the school provides. Anyway, we plan to send unvaccinated children back to school to the whole life of the children who are detached from the life of the family, so there is a loss of life of the children in the family that there is still more transmissible as a recipe for me.\"\n",

I've always had pretty substantial health anxiety; I actually had a bit of a breakdown in March of 2020 (quit my job and everything). I live in a very rural, Republican area, and everyone around me is constantly bashing the vaccine and spreading HUGE amounts of scary and sometimes false information.

On one hand, I'm scared to get vaccinated, but on the other, I'm absolutely petrified of getting Covid. I'm so scared of the rare but possible side effects of the vaccine, but of course, I'm more scared of the long-term side effects of actually contracting Covid-19. I've heard all sorts of side effects from the vaccine, like myocarditis and pericarditis, blood clots, heavier menstruation, and it all just really scares me. I think what I'm searching for in particular are words of wisdom from all walks of life. Whether you got vaccinated right away with no second thought, whether you were on the fence like me, or even if you were 100% against it and got it anyway.

Knowing how happy and reactionary blockade Canadian governments can be terrified by the fall that is just like autumn 2020. I can't lose another year of life again. My fear is that the unvaccinated will lead a big wave and the province will go full block mode as a reactionary measure. If we have to block again with so many vaccinated people then I will have lost all life's hope and be completely defeated. If the vaccines can't stop this, then I will have turned it off. I don't know how to stop my spiral thinking. I've tried to avoid all the news and counting of cases but its inescapable. Lockdowns would again mean losing my secondary projects in events and almost let me down.\"\n",

It's not a smart thing to do on my part but I've had a tough year and it was the last thing on my mind. I've heard some people say that at my age it's not worth it to take the vaccine because the benefits of not catching a virus that would likely not do much harm to me to begin with is overshadowed by any potential side effects that the vaccine could cause. Is this true? Am I just overthinking this? Could there be any long term side effects from any of these vaccines, or will it really most likely not impact my life in any way other than just maybe getting sick for a couple of days after taking the vaccine (which has happened to some people I know)?

I feel like Ive been mostly very lucky with how my family takes Covid seriously, but Im just at my emotional wits end trying to explain something that seems like it should be obvious.

I feel like Im on crazy pills and dont know how to explain it to them in a way that doesnt make me want to pull my hair out. Theyre looking at the rates of hospitalization and deaths in each state, per 100,000, for fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people. Theyre looking at data reported by the NYTimes which was updated 3 days ago. So for example, California, where we live, has reported 647 hospitalizations and 58 deaths for unvaccinated people, and 9 hospitalizations and 1 death for vaccinated people. Now, theyre calculating that 58/647= .089, and 1/9= .11, so you have a higher chance of dying in the hospital from Covid if youre vaccinated (instead of realizing that this data really means you are 58X more likely to die of Covid if youre unvaccinated in CA). Basically theyre saying the vaccine doesnt work to help people who are already hospitalized because you have a higher rate of dying in the hospital if youre vaccinated. This data may be *technically* correct, but its missing the context of the fact that the vaccine keeps people out of the hospital in the first place so one person out of nine dying skews the number outrageously. So what do you guys think, how do I explain to them that this interpretation of data is erroneous??\"\n",

I tested positive for COVID after pretty much my whole family got it. While I only tested positive in the last 16 hours, I have felt off since 8/12. Here is where I'll let you in on my dilemma, and I do not expect pretty much any of you to agree with me. There is a girl that I work with that I think is insanely pretty and cool. I have been gradually getting closer to her over the last few months and I feel like we're really starting to become friends. The problem is, her last day of work is on 8/20 before she goes back to school, and I would really like to stay in contact with her while she is at school. I was planning on asking for her snapchat on 8/20 which is the next and last time I will see her for some time. My COVID diagnosis threw me for a loop I did not expect and if I follow all guidelines I will not be able to see her by the time she leaves for school. This has led to me planning to hide my diagnosis in order to see her and talk to her before she goes away until December. Obviously this puts her and my other coworkers at risk of catching the virus, but I feel like I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't make an effort to talk to her. I know this is immature, and I know that this has an answer that is very obvious to most. I only ask for respectful feedback. Honestly, I'm not sure that I didn't write this up to sort of get my thoughts out in the open, but I really like this girl and want to pursue a relationship with her. Even if not a romantic relationship, I just think she is super cool. Thanks for reading and TIA to anyone with any feedback.\"\n",

It was the best decision, because I was able to spend an entire month with my family member, and left feeling at least somewhat less heavy-hearted. The problems is that my residence country will *not* accept my vaccination record from the other country, and so I am officially \\\"not fully vaccinated.\\\" What this means is that I cannot be granted the current \\\"Vaccination Passport\\\" available to all residents, which allows those fully vaccinated to travel to all other EU countries without quarantine, testing, or other problems. Without this, traveling - which I need to do for my work - will become extremely difficult, often impossible. So I'm thinking of just going to get my \\\"second\\\" vaccine here in my country of residence, which is now available, and then the authorities will issue the passport so that I can get on with my life as much as possible. I have read quite a few things from what appear to be reasonable sources online, and it seems that getting a third vaccine within a period of three months wouldn't be harmful - but I obviously want to be very, very careful.

I can't even get AZ in my area, some can. But basically if you are under 30 there are no vaccines available still. They doubled the cost of university courses during this pandemic, when the uni experience is no longer even half as good as it was. I have no motivation to study in that environment and them doubling the cost has pretty much made me think no way. my age group has the lowest employment rate yet we are the most inelligible for government support in this time. I am sick of trying when everything is made harder, and then my problems are minimized because I am young. I feel like my youth was destroyed by this toxic society, i never got to live the life I wanted, and now covid has trapped me even further in this miserable cycle. I really can't believe that I am nearly 30, basically begging for entry level work or welfare and can't get fucking either. I don't know what I will do in a few months time.\"\n",

I know individual levels can vary and that we still don't know what antibody levels = immunity, but it would still be interested to know the common ranges seen after vaccination. Has anyone else gotten a test for the spike protein antibodies post vaccination? Would love to hear your results if you feel comfortable sharing. P.S. I'm basing my vaccination decisions off expert recommendations and studies surrounding reinfection rates/previous immunity vs vaccination immunity, etc. not off this Reddit thread - don't worry. :) But as someone who has a little bit of nervousness around taking any medication and who loves data, this type of information gives me more confidence in my decision.\"\n",

I live with my parents, one of whom has had historic lung issues, is 71, and also probably high risk. We're all fully vaccinated. My goal, really, throughout all this is to reduce my chance of *infection* to near zero. It's hard to imagine an infection, even asymptomatic, couldn't pose a serious threat for my parents, much less the terrifying risk of long covid. I know being vaccinated my chances of hospitalization and death are low, that's not really what I'm worried about. I'm a wind player, and theoretically have an orchestra concert coming up mid september. I'm in Oregon where cases are pretty out of control. From what research I've seen, playing a wind instrument is essentially identical to just talking in terms of risk factor. So that's fine. Assuming no precautions are taken, that'll be something like 20 people within 15 feet of me, possibly unvaccinated, unmasked, not particularly well ventilated space, for multiple hours. To me that is very clearly an untenable risk, even though I am vaccinated. I guess the first gut check - am I already being over-cautious in thinking that? If I'm right that that is way too risky. What precautions would be reasonable to ask for? If everyone is vaccinated, all non-wind players are masked, and I'm 6 feet away from everyone else, that's about as many mitigating factors as possible - and I honestly can't tell if that's enough to be safe or not. It's still being unmasked in a room full of people for hours, doing an activity that for me involves a lot of deep breaths. I suspect, on one hand, I may be too cautious in thinking those measures wouldn't be enough? and the other hand I can't help but shake the fear that it won't work out okay\"\n",

I have found some information saying that it may be as often as a month, yet others dispute this in certain cases. Thank you very much!\"\n",

We all wear masks but Im wondering how many people are walking around thinking they have allergies when its covid. This is a special type of hell.

I know I can get a recovery test from a doctor or public health official, but I'm not really sure how simple it would be for an American in the UK? I really don't know, I might be more complicated in my mind due to the stress of being away from home.\"\n",

I've told him this, and although he's not playing it as safe in his own life, he respects it. However, last night at the end of the date, he wanted to kiss, and while I said no due to having to social distance, it prompted me to think...what would the future of us dating look like? Obviously, physical touch is part of a relationship and idk how long he'll wait to even be able to hug me. Do I ask him to reconsider his safety precautions? Do we both get tested before we hangout? What's fair to ask of him? I really wanna make it work, but protecting my family is important too. Oh, and a little more info, we're both vaccinated, but he's going on without a mask, and into pretty public, crowded places. I still wear my mask everywhere but the outdoors and avoid busy, crowded places. The only people my family would be comfortable with me having around without any precautions is someone who is living similarly.

One of my good buddies just informed the group chat last night that he tested positive for Covid four days ago (Thursday), and showed flu-like symptoms at the beginning of the week (Monday). He said that he is feeling better, and by the time we leave for the trip, which is this Thursday it will be 10 days he's been in isolation and according to the CDC, he should be cleared to resocialize and therefore not miss the trip. I know there are a lot of factors and it's hard to determine when it might be safe to be around others, but that time frame still seems very tight. For the record, everyone in our party is fully vaccinated, so there is some protection. But we will be in tight quarters for a few days, and I'll be in close contact with family for some time after this trip. We are all getting tested, and he said he will as well. There is a light understanding that if he tests positive that he won't go, but he has been kind of forward stating that there is a high probability he will even if he is \\\"Not Contagious\\\". Which makes me feel like he might try to attend regardless. The fact that it's a breakthrough infection is making me feel a little overly cautious about wanting to attend. Overall, is that timeline a little too tight or am I overthinking things? \\\\------------------------------------------- **TL;DR** \\\\- A friend had a breakthrough infection less than a week ago, showing flu-like symptoms. He's feeling better, but would like to still attend a trip we leave for this week, which would mark exactly 10 days he's been in isolation since showing symptoms but would be 7 days after he's tested positive. Is that timeframe too tight, and am I overthinking about not attending the trip?\"\n",

I know not everyone will have the same experience, but whos to say who will and who wont ? Covid isnt any better either. Lots of people made me feel crazy for getting the vaccine; I was super excited to get it but now Im terrified. Has anyone gone through the same thing? My depression has gotten so bad because Ive been in the house for so long. This pandemic having no end in sight, people dying left and right, the constant fear mongering, life being so dull and the future uncertain... its all too much. I dont understand people who are living life normally as if we are not in a global pandemic. I dont know what to do. Ive been feeling like this since quarantine started (1st year of university) and now Im in my 3rd year. I miss crowds and not having to worry about catching a killer virus every second of my life. I hate wearing masks. I hate having to social distance. I hate not being able to do anything. Almost 2 years of reliving the same day over and over again....\"\n",

So everyone else has tried and so far all (including children) are negative (we propose to try again in a few days). They said they have had common colds that feel twenty times worse.\"\n",

I'm hoping this is just worse allergies than usual or the Fall cold I usually get during back-to-school that I avoided last year, but I can't help but feel angry. I live in a small college town.

He feels like his rights are violated heavily and while I agree with him on how wrong things are, I dont think he should miss the birth of his child for it; its his first child and we are not having anymore kids. I already have a child with a previous partner and do not want to get pregnant a 3rd time. He does not want to get vaccinated which is his right but I believe the Hosptial we are giving birth at requires non vaccinated people to have a mask on at all times. (Vaccinated people do have to wear one as well but I do not have to wear one during childbirth if I come out negative for Covid + proof of vaccine) I told him that if he doesnt want to wear the mask to stay home and not cause anyone stress but he wants to be there. He just doesnt want to not be forced to wear a mask the entire time and will only leave if forced to leave. I dont know what to do because I believe in what hes saying but i dont understand why he cant be selfless about this if its for the birth of his child. Idk if its the right sub for this but what do I do if hes right in saying he has the right to do what he wants but he inevitably wont be able to support me by choosing to stay on his stance of things?\"\n",

But there is a huge fear of the hospitals being overrun here when we open up, of cases and possibly deaths skyrocketing and having to go back into lockdown even at high vaccination rates. I am feeling so defeated right now, although I am fully vaxxed so its some comfort to be protected. I really need to hear any hopeful words right now because the mood in our city is beyond dire. Can someone give me something to hope for, something that can help me be even a bit positive about the future? Thanks.\"\n",

Unfortunately, due to the launch of vaccines in our country, as well as the Delta variant that the reputation has been destroyed in 2021. We are currently at our worst absolute point since the pandemic began. Today we have 1435 cases, which I know if you are from America or Europe you can look at us and think that this number is small, but for us this is huge and incredibly demoralizing. We are willing to block out around October 28th, which is when it was expected to hit 70% double doses and we will have more freedoms once we are 80% double doses. But there is a great fear of the hospitals that are being invaded here, because it may be something that can be given in the hope that when we open up, of cases and possibly deaths broaching and have to reblock even at high rates of vaccination.\"\n",

We weren't really worried, since she has the best immune system out of all the family members, although she has been badly sick around 4-5 times ever since I'm alive, and I'm 20. To be honest I can't imagine someone being healthier than her. At 47, I wouldn't consider her to be old, she doesn't drink or smoke, she is fit, no heart problems, no diabetes, basically nothing that would put her at higher risk. She started having a dry cough and a fever, so I suggested that she should go get tested and she did 2 days ago. It came back positive. This was quite possibly my worst fear, since she never got vaccinated. She isn't antivax or anything like that, me and my sister got all the neccessary vaccinations children get, it's just about how quickly the covid vaccine was made. Or so she said. So today, she was in the worst condition I have ever seen her in. She didn't really have a fever during the day. Only a terrible headache, a burning stomach, and a burning chest. No shortness of breath or anything like that. Obviously her strength is close to zero, but that's really common, so I was not really worried about that. Now that it's around midnight, her fever came back, so I gave her some painkillers and she is now sleeping. I would greatly appreciate some tips on how to make her feel better, since I'm really worried about her. I really really don't want her to have any complications. Also, if anybody here had the same symptoms (burning stomach, burning chest or the headache without fever), please feel free to share any tips that helped you or helped someone else you know.

But I'm starting to notice that whenever I'm browsing Reddit, the most reassuring things I see are updates from well-established Twitter experts that do a good job of describing the situation in a balanced manner (e.g. <PERSON> with the vaccination updates and Chise with the Omicron updates). Because of this, I'm deciding that a better approach may be to just refer to well-established experts in order to stay up to date on Covid. It's honestly a win-win. I'm not putting my head in the sand, but neither am I doomscrolling and destroying my mental health. So I just want to ask you guys - what are some other good experts that you recommend getting information from? Ones that are balanced in their presentation of the facts - not doom and gloom, but not blindly optimistic either. I'll just go to them for my daily Covid updates from now on, and this way I'll stay \\\"awake\\\" without all the needless anxiety.\"\n",

Anyway, it looks like all of them and their grandmothers are getting Covid tonight in NYC/DC. so they were a bit silly. I have a generalized anxiety disorder so I'm pretty sure that the worst (and a little likely) is that my family is falling with some disease before flying.\"\n",

He's never officially had covid before, neither have I or my mom. He actually lied and said he got tested when he really didn't.

And even though he hasn't gotten sick throughout this whole pandemic, with how transmissible the new variant is, it seems to be pretty inevitable. He works retail, and to add to it all, he's also anti-mask. I didn't go home for Thanksgiving for this reason, and of course my parents were both pissed. Now that Christmas is coming, they're even more angry as you can imagine. Realistically I know I wouldn't be severely ill if I got covid (vaccinated, 21 and healthy) but I'm absolutely terrified of getting a mild case and having it develop into long-haul covid. That's my biggest fear. I'm not sure what to do here. I spent Thanksgiving with a few vaccinated friends, but everyone's with their families for Christmas, and I don't want to be alone. Another option is for my mom to come over to my apartment, without my dad, but at the same time I feel guilty for leaving him alone on Christmas. Am I exaggerating with this? I don't want to spend Christmas alone but at the same time I really don't want to potentially have long-haul symptoms for months or even years because of this decision.\"\n",

I was finally scheduled for November when my husband hired a co-worker's co-worker and brought her home. So before I received my second dose, everyone at my house (I, and the children also) caught co-worker. We went into quarantine, asked for food so we wouldn't have to go out, etc. All through the book. We recovered ( luckily it was very soft for us) and we're back to work and school. Here are my questions. All those around are getting vaccines and now even the children are getting vaccines. I've been asking around whether we should receive boosters or not and still getting mixed answers. Some people are telling me since I coved, it's not necessary for me for a while, we have to have antibodies in us. Including the children to me.\"\n",

Not only are we co-workers but were also sort of buddies. I immediately tested on Tuesday and came back negative.

The other thought going through my mind is that I havent seen my mom in forever and I dont want to stay separated from them forever. I would be destroyed if something happened to them and I havent seen them in years. However, I could cause the same thing by traveling. My gut says I shouldnt. Its not worth the risk. But I am also feeling the pressure (particularly from my dad) to come home. I want to so bad and I know statistically speaking nothing drastic is likely to happen but I just want to do the right thing. This on top of the general risk of contracting the virus in the airport. Any advice?\"\n",

Tuesday this week, you can't get to something that was seen through the mind, but that we're not just coworkers, but it was also kind of like a coworkers. I immediately tried on Tuesday and I came back negative. However, if I was exposed to it on Monday or Tuesday, it's most likely that I wouldn't show up. I'm testing myself again tonight (Thursday). However, I have a flight tomorrow to visit my parents during the week. My parents are at the beginning of the 60's, but they say they're in good health, except that my mother is not vaccinated. I'm now facing this situation where I could test myself positive here next couple of days. However, I have to think about it forever. I don't want to risk it to my parents, but they say they don't care about the risk to them.\"\n",

But either way, you're gonna get through Christmas, and you're gonna get through the next few months of COVID, and then you're gonna get through whatever comes next, and you'll look back and realise you're so far in the future away from your worst moments and it'll feel like no time has passed at all.

We've struggled with our minds and we win. Many of us (absolutely me included) will be having waves of despair and fear that they come and go and back a little and beat us one. And that's fine - what we've gone through would definitely be a kind of trauma, especially if they've had difficult circumstances, personal encounters with COVID, they're going to lose the news, or the supportive interactions are going to be felt. We shouldn't wait to feel desperate after all that.

Apparently his dad lied that the negative result from the day before we gathered was from a pcr, and actually came from a rapid home test. (Can I add that I hate how inconsistent and unreliable all these tests seem to be?) The kid apparently had some mild symptoms about a week before christmas and promptly got tested, and the doctor didn't think it was covid. Nobody informed us about this. If I had known I wouldn't have taken the chance What's worse, I went to the gathering with some family friends, and they're much more concerned about this, so they wanted everyone to test negative in some capacity. I did with a home test, but that was only a day after the (at the time unaware) exposure. And I feel so guilty and don't know what to say And what's WORSE worse, is I have both a small new years eve hangout at a friend's house and a convention coming up very shortly.

Can I, for example, play table tennis without me or my coach wearing a mask? I play indoors, it's a small space that is empty most of the time and my coach is vaccinated.

We have a walking area where I live, most people there don't wear masks and I don't know if they are vaccinated, would it be safe for me to go and walk amidst them while wearing a mask? 4. Is it safe for me to go to restaurants? 5. I read that the protection from the vaccine wanes over time. If it is safe for me to go out, assuming that I can't get a booster, how long is it safe before the protection will decrease to the point where I need to stay home, and avoid going out again? 6. Should I isolate everytime I feel feverish or get a fever, or everytime I meet someone, and later find out that they got a fever? 7. Should I be worried about long covid, I read a [post]([url] here about a vaccinated person who got brain fog after getting COVID, should I be worried about this? 8. Are there any general rules or things to keep in mind to help me make these decisions? Like before the vaccine, there were guidelines such as maintaining a distance of six feet and avoiding crowded spaces, washing hands for 20/60 seconds, avoiding being indoors with other people when possible, etc. I'm not sure what precautions I can stop taking and which ones are still very important.

This part has worried me since the beginning; he does not see the point of getting vaccinated and he frequently goes out. To make things worse, his job requires close contact with people and he relies too much on his immune. Ive tried so many times but I have no idea what else I can do. He doesnt like to listen, but he would usually hear me out if I start crying(according to my sister). I had already left his place in tears leaving him confused, and I am wondering if Im being over dramatic about this. Im glad theyre both choosing to take more precautions and take it more seriously, but I just want them to get better. When I try to look up news/information, I become more overwhelmed and confused as to how deadly this virus/variant is and where we are as a country. And I keep worrying about whether my dads age will affect him too much and how possible is it for both of them to have a good recovery.

Of course, it is impossible to get into a hospital or doctor's office right now. He ended up going to an urgent care who administered an anti-inflammatory and released him; he has a follow up with a pcp today for bloodwork and to see what other steps are necessary. Not only do I feel some guilt about pushing my family to get boosted so hard, but I feel especially bad for my brother because, as a 21M, he would be fine even if he got COVID. This was just never even really a threat to him, now he has myocarditis from it, and oh, he probably will still be susceptible to omicron anyways. I am struggling to find literature or accurate discussions on the risks of myocarditis vs COVID in young adults, which is frustrating as it feels like you are shamed for even asking if any of the risks are worth it for young people. This is all on top of the difficulties he and all other young people are facing by having had gone through 2+ years of college under COVID times. I just feel guilty about all of this. I think I'm done with my boosters for the next couple years. Unless they develop one that is going to actually protect against variants and not allow you to spread the virus, I'm just so disillusioned with how ineffective they truly are. Yeah, I get that they still prevent \\\"death and hospitalization\\\", but the fact that you can still catch the virus, spread the virus, get not-mild \\\"mild\\\" symptoms from the virus, and need to socially distance, mask, isolate is depressing. And now that a family member of mine has literally suffered more from the vaccine than from the virus (none of my family members have had COVID), I can't justify getting my 4th shot within 14 months or whatever it will be when they inevitably roll that policy out.\"\n",

About 3 weeks ago my husband (m31) tested positive for Covid. He was very low on energy and slept ALOT for about a week. Finally, we noticed his oxygen saturation was dropping off and on. On day 7 of him being positive, his oxygen saturation dropped to 83. So, we had him sent to the hospital via ambulance. He stayed in the hospital for 8 days. After a day and a half he was bumped from 5 liters of oxygen to a heated high flow 50 liters. He stayed on that for about 3 days and then they slowly decreased. He was discharged about a week ago, but he still has to use oxygen when he sleeps and sometimes throughout the day. His PCP says he needs to stick with it for at least another month. My husband is very determined to stop using it as much and he is pushing himself. I understand he doesnt want to use it forever, but his doctor says it will take one day at a time. I am hopeful that he will be able to come off of it soon, but I fear that my husband is rushing it. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!\"\n",

About 3 weeks ago my husband (m31) proved positive for Covid. He was very low in energy and slept ALOT for about a week. Finally, we realized that his oxygen saturation was falling and continuing. On the 7th day of he being positive, his oxygen saturation fell to 83. So, we sent him to the hospital by ambulance. He stayed in the hospital for 8 days. After a day and a half he was beaten from 5 liters of oxygen to a high hot flow of 50 liters. He stayed in it for about 3 days and then slowly decreased. He was discharged a week ago, but still has to use oxygen when he sleeps and sometimes throughout the day. His PCP says he needs to stay with him for at least a month.\"\n",

And now I'm so scared I will have to do the same, but still trying to be positive and manifest a good outcome. The day before Christmas, my own dad tested positive for covid, had typical cold symptoms, said he felt fine otherwise. I bought him an oximeter and yesterday he started feeling worse and his blood oxygen level was at 42% so I brought him to the hospital. He called me and sounded so scared and confused and asked me to come pick him up and bring him to the hospital. His healthcare team said it's an extreme case of covid and there is a high probability that he may be intubated. If he maxes out on the oxygen through his cannula, he will move to CPAP, and then to a vent. The doctor said he's now at a point where patients typically start to gradually improve, or take a sharp decline and have to end up on a vent, which has a 50% mortality rate for my dad's age. Thankfully his oxygen level is staying above 90% while he's got the cannula in and is thinking more clearly, etc. It could really go either way right now. I can't go see him, he can't really talk on the phone, I couldn't even wait with him in the ER waiting room. Just had to hug him real quick, tell him I love him, and then leave. Anyone else been here or had a family member in this position? Any tips to help him not panic to keep his breathing steady? Any tips for me and what I should be asking the doctors, etc? He is unmarried and I am the eldest child. I just can't imagine losing my father so young. He is only 50 and I am 26. Could use some words of encouragement and positive recovery stories.\"\n",

And now I'm so scared I will have to do the same, but still trying to be positive and manifest a good outcome. The day before Christmas, my own dad tested positive for covid, had typical cold symptoms, said he felt fine otherwise. I bought him an oximeter and yesterday he started feeling worse and his blood oxygen level was at 42% so I brought him to the hospital. He called me and sounded so scared and confused and asked me to come pick him up and bring him to the hospital. His healthcare team said it's an extreme case of covid and there is a high probability that he may be intubated. If he maxes out on the oxygen through his cannula, he will move to CPAP, and then to a vent. The doctor said he's now at a point where patients typically start to gradually improve, or take a sharp decline and have to end up on a vent, which has a 50% mortality rate for my dad's age. Thankfully his oxygen level is staying above 90% while he's got the cannula in and is thinking more clearly, etc. It could really go either way right now. I can't go see him, he can't really talk on the phone, I couldn't even wait with him in the ER waiting room. Just had to hug him real quick, tell him I love him, and then leave. Anyone else been here or had a family member in this position? Any tips to help him not panic to keep his breathing steady? Any tips for me and what I should be asking the doctors, etc? He is unmarried and I am the eldest child. I just can't imagine losing my father so young. He is only 50 and I am 26. Could use some words of encouragement and positive recovery stories.\"\n",

I lived my life like I had no fear of getting it anytime soon; nothing crazy just went to a small bar a couple of nights. Come Jan 1st, and I wake up with a slightly stuffy nose. Later that night, my sister, who I spent every second of the trip, tested positive for covid. After that moment I became extremely worried that my congestion was covid and it only got worse with flying back. I tested on the 2nd after my flight and my antigen came back positive. I freaked out. Can I have it again after only getting it 20 days ago, or is it just a false positive? Extra concerned as my antigen test on the 24th was negative and now my at-home one is positive.

I tried positive on December 14th, 20 days ago. After being cleaned up by my university on the 24th, I went to Europe to meet my family after a negative CVS antigen. I lived my life as if I wasn't afraid to get it soon; nothing crazy only went to a small bar for a couple of nights. January 1st, and I woke up with a slightly stuck nose. Later that night, my sister, who spent every second of the trip, proved positive for covet. After that moment I was very worried that my congestion was ripe and only got worse with the flight back. I tried in the second after my flight and my antigen came positive. It excited me. Can I have it again after just 20 days ago, or is it just a false positive?\"\n",

Immediately upon finding this out i took a rapid test and it was negative, and then today i took a PCR and am waiting for results. My mother with whom i'm staying with is severely immunocompromised (like had open heart surgery a year ago and one of her lungs doesnt work properly). So despite having been in in very close contact with her i am now distancing from her and everyone else in the house and wearing a mask. Then, today we discovered that a family member who was here on the 1st just tested positive on a rapid test today. So, i have a couple of questions cause we're all kind of freaking out right now. 1) How likely is it that i have covid right now (from the person i was with on the 29th)? 2) It is even possible for me to have transmitted covid to this family member who was here on the first? If i was carrying it, my time of contact with the virus would have been only 4 days prior. Is this enough time for me to have then transmitted it to someone else? 3) What exactly is safe to do in my house? Right now i am confining myself to either my bedroom (mask off) or in an adjacent bonus room (with a mask on). This room is fairly large, and a couple of people in the house pass through it a few times a day, generally passing about 15-20 feet away from me. How likely is it that i can pass the virus to them while being in this room, with a mask on? Thanks, appreciate any help i can get. Note: everyone in my family has 2 vaccines, my mother has had 3. Exactly how at risk of hospitalization/death is she? We're all deeply concerned.\"\n",

I'm constantly trying to make sense why we're one of the only countries in full lockdown, and it seems at least partially due to our low ICU (critical care) capacity, meaning the potential for our hospitals to become overwhelmed is far higher than in other countries. Now, I've clung to the hope that pandemics in the end will end once enough people have contracted the virus / become vaccinated, but the following article worries me a bit: [[url] It says that getting the viruss reproductive number down to one is just the bare minimum for earning the endemic classification (instead of a pandemic), and the moment it stops being a threat will differ per country and depends on factors like hospital / ICU capacity. So since we had kind of a healthcare crisis even before the pandemic, I'm very worried that we might be stuck with restrictions way longer than other countries. Even before covid, in 2018 we had to postpone some operations due to a heavy flu season. The government planning \\\"long term strategies\\\" where we will indefinitely move large gatherings to the summer and \\\"stay low\\\" during the winter doesn't help either... Can anyone give some reassurance / thoughts? TLDR; I'm worried the problem with limited critical care in the Netherlands will keep us from moving beyond this crisis\"\n",

Everyone I know at uni is double vaccinated but only a few have had the booster. I just want to enjoy university life but this threat of catching covid is just looming over my head like some kind of inevitable fate. I don't know what to do because the only other option is to drop out of uni and become a house mouse which would make my mental health suffer as I'm extremely extroverted. I'm not so afraid of catching covid and having a mild illness I'm TERRIFIED of this then turning into long covid and being basically permanently disabled for the rest of my life (the brain fog symptoms scare me the most).

As part of the agreement, he spent a few days with her over New Years. He left the 30th and was supposed to come back the 4th. During the night 31st--&gt;1st, he calls me at 2am, panicking: his mom tested positive with a home test for COVID, and he tested negative. The earliest I could pick him back up was the 2nd, and he isolated as much as possible between then and when I could pick him up. Upon returning to my place we were meticulously cautious. He's confined in his room, even for his meals, - he doesn't step outside except to use the washroom which I clean after every use. I try to keep it light, stay - both masked - more than 2m from each other to discuss his homework and read stuff to each other. The days are passing and he remains 100% symptoms free. I'm assuming he was exposed right when he went over there, on the 30th, which would make it day \\\"1\\\", and would make today day \\\"9\\\", although I'm assuming that the most cautious scenario would be to consider the last contact with her (Jan 2nd) as day \\\"1\\\", which would only make today day \\\"6\\\". Here's the thing though: it's start to weigh on both him and me, and the idea that we couldn't even have the week-end to do anything together is making him be quite down. Whether we consider today day 6 or day 9, he's still rigorously symptoms-free. Can you help me think through the risks here? I don't want to end his quarantine before it's logical to do so, but I can see the effect it's having... Looking fw to your thoughts\"\n",

When I heard the news about how contagious omicron is, I kind of just... accepted the reality that getting it was a definite possibility, even as a vaccinated person.

So, if you've read my previous posts, you'll know my situation of living with antivax parents and how that has affected me mentally speaking.

No side effects, apart from pain in the place of the injection. It's been more than 24 hours, so I guess I'm good on that side. It honestly feels surreal. I didn't even plan for it to happen that way, it was a spur of the moment decision. But now something troubles me. I fear my family may get to know it, and I don't feel the same having to hide it from them. I fear I was being impulsive and the best choice was to wait. I try to tell myself I had little choice, with Delta increasing the cases in my town, but it doesn't feel that way. There's also the fears theorists have put on my head, like infertility or altered DNA. Did I do it right? Or I should've just wait? I know it sounds silly, but I'm really second guessing myself. I was actually going to poost here for advice before going to the hospital, but as I said, it was pretty much a spontaneus decision. Thank you for reading, and to anyone who comments.

There are so many questions I realized I couldn't answer with certainty when discussing Covid with them. I was hoping to get some help for answers here. 1. If you are vaccinated, are you less likely to spread the virus? For example, if I am vaccinated and my cousin is not, we both meet my uncle who has Covid and are exposed. Since I am vaccinated, is there a higher chance that my body rejects the virus and so I don't become a carrier and spread it to others? If so, how much higher are the odds (if all other things are equal)? 2. If you had Covid previously, do you have a lesser chance of spreading it? Do Covid survivors have some immunity, so when they are exposed to someone with Covid, they have a much lesser chance to becoming a carrier. Since I had Covid AND I am vaccinated, am I much less likely to be a carrier now? Obviously, there are a lot of variables, but these questions are about the general odds. It seems like the narrative is constantly changing so it gets confusing. For example, now the news seems to be saying that even if your vaccinated you're going to get Covid, but you'll have milder symptoms. Or that you can spread it almost as easily as someone who is not vaccinated, etc. It would be great to see some very clear stats -- eg. if you are vaccinated, and you are exposed to someone with Covid, you are 90% less likely to become a carrier and spread it to others -- or something like this.

So the only high-risk activities we would be doing would be interacting with the reception of the hotel and interacting with the 2 people who will give us the visits of the places.

Don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful for the vaccine, but it feels like with so many breakthrough cases that I should just expect to get reinfected. I've read booster efficacy sits around 75%. I feel like that should be more reassuring than what my current state of mind has me feeling. I used to feel a sense of comfort, having been vaccinated and having \\\"hybrid\\\" immunity, etc, but this surge of Omicron has really crushed that feeling.

We're both always masked(me with a kn95, her a surgical mask) and vaxxed(I'm also boosted). The reason it's possible is that she had a cold over the winter break that she could never get tested for, but might have been covid and that showed on the PCR. Her rapid test for re-entering school on Monday was negative. She's supposed to take another rapid test on Saturday, so we'll see how that goes. I'm not especially worried for myself. I'm triple vaxxed, 31, and healthy. My dilemma comes from living with my 70 year old mother and 66 year old, diabetic father. They're also triple vaxxed, and my dad's diabetes is actually pretty controlled, but obviously I want to protect them. Aside from masking around the house, and staying confined to my room as much as possible, is there anything I can do? In addition, because I'm triple vaxxed, currently negative, and asymptomatic, I'm still going into work, where I'm masked and staying inside our office, unless asked to cover a class because they're very short-staffed, unfortunately. Anything I can do to keep the kids safe? Any extra precautions I should take? I know the CDC doesn't recommend quarantine, just masking, is that.... fine?

In March of 2020 my PCP suggested that I not work in a retail grocery environment until the scope of Covid was known. After speaking with my manager I was put on Medical Leave of Absence which allowed me to keep and self pay for my healthcare. My wife and I went into hard lockdown. Mostly deliveries of food, although I did do a little shopping at TJ's when they used to have senior hours. Fast forward to June of 2021. The grocery store called and said I either had to return to work or resign. This was a corporate wide policy. I resigned. The COBRA premiums were $790 per month. While I still had some savings, this was really beyond my budget. In September I got a job with a very small company. I work as an electromechanical tech fixing receipt printers. I have never removed my mask while in the building. Lunch? In my car. Sip of tea? Step outside. Snack or fruit? Step outside. On the 7th of this month one of my colleagues was in the same room as I and started to have a coughing fit. He ripped his mask OFF and coughed for 10 or 15 seconds. It must have been in that brief moment that he infected me. When I showed to work the next he was not in. I scheduled a PCR test and thankfully was able to schedule one for that Friday. When I woke that morning I had some unexplainable aches and pains. I was at work, but following my test appointment I went home. That night I had coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and a slight fever. It was either Thursday or Friday that I infected my wife. She has similar symptoms, but she has also lost senses of taste and smell. I cannot say just how angry I am at me colleague. Maybe it was the way I was brought up, but if I have a coughing fit I cover my mouth, not rip a protective barrier off. Anyway, just wanted to rant a little bit, thanks for reading.\"\n",

I swear I could hear her tossing stuff in her house, the call went on for half an hour. She eventually just hung up.

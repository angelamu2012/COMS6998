Those who don't are shunned from society, punished, harassed, like in Muslim society if a woman does not cover her head, she risks to be stoned. While the vaccine enforces a two-tier society, between true believers and those who resist, who will be rejected from society and also from having a job.

They advocated sending children back into poorly ventilated, Covid infested schools so moms &amp; dads could then return to Covid infested work environments as quickly as possible. In addition to no emphasis being put on masking, they never bothered to tell the public that when something is airborne, the eyes are a point of entry. My hubs and I had to learn that from my doctors and virologists we personally sought out. The Covid response had everything to do with making sure the economy didn't take a hit and nothing to do with actual science.

I know this is a tough time for a lot of us here, since this is around the 3-year anniversary of When This All Began. So taking a page from some of the past positivity threads: here we can take a moment and celebrate some small victories, some happy things, however big or small...whether you recently got together safely with some friends and loved ones...started a new hobby...finished a project...tried a new recipe...whatever you'd like to share. :) I recently started playing the new \\\"Sports\\\" game on Nintendo Switch--bowling, badminton, tennis, chambara, golf, and a few more! It is SO MUCH FUN. And you're playing against people from all over the world! The bowling is set up in a mall-type setting, so there are a lot of other \\\"people\\\" milling around in the background, coffee shops, etc. It's a fun atmosphere! Is there a way to set up a virtual bowling team? LOL I also saw an ADORABLE brown bunny last night in the yard, happily munching away on a few weeds. A good sign on the 1st day of Spring! Hang in there everyone...Keep doing what you are doing, stay the course. Spring is just around the corner!\",\n",

No one is using common sense or thinking for themselves on this when the fact is that they have the ability to mandate masks no matter what the CDC says.

Really what Im just describing is a healthy functioning community, but thats so hard to find irl in the States, at least in my recent experience. People are often isolated and forced to be meaninglessly self-reliant even pre-pandemic. It would be so nice to live next to people you had regular interactions with without worrying if they were keeping themselves safe or not. To allow yourself a degree of vulnerability in a community without being punished for it. I dont have any concrete immediate plans on how to build or sustain something like that, beyond just generally connecting with and organizing with people in the short term, but the thought of imagining even a simple, small, but safe and happy future does give me some joy and its nice.\",\n",

Instead, our immune system essentially decides to stop fighting it and let it exist at a low level, rather than ramping up and trying to eradicate it and risk harming our own tissues. Maybe for those of us with LC, our bodies made the decision not to go into the cytokine storm, but as a result we didnt eradicate the virus and are now living with it and all of its downstream effects, like microclotting.

The COVID vaccines are 95% effective against infection Now, onto climate change science. This is funded by basically the exact same people who fund COVID science, like Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum. This science, like COVID science, blames humans for all the world's ills. And climate science always involves some NWO solutions like blocking the sun. Heck, I've sometimes heard climate lockdowns suggested too. Aren't we really just returning to normal after the Little Ice Age? The Little Ice Age only ended about 150-170 years ago, and I'm pretty sure it was the coldest period since the Big Ice Age. Even if humans are causing the world to get warmer, why is this a bad thing? Why does the climate change cult want it to be so cold?\",\n",

I started my covid journey last October when I went to a small halloween gathering a friend was throwing. Life was an absolute living hell from that point on until pretty recently... I saw my primary and my allergist and they both told me they couldn't tell why I felt like I was suffocating and I should see a Pulmonoligist. At this point appointments were 3 months out, so I spent every day just praying I would make it to my appointment before I died. After an excruciating wait I finally got in to see a Pulmonoligist only to be poked and prodded for 5 hours to be told I had absolutely nothing wrong with me. This was probably the hardest point because I knew there was something wrong with me but I felt like nobody would just admit they had no idea and I got the typical \\\"probably just anxiety bro.\\\". Things have really brightened up over the past few months and I have no idea why. I've started doing mild exercise, I'm in school to learn to code so I can work remotely and travel, I'm regularly hanging out with friends again and back to doing most of the things I love. I'm still not in good shape by any means, but for the first time since this whole thing started I'm confident I'll get there. I wish I knew why I started getting better all the sudden so I could tell you guys how to get healthy again, but the truth is I have no idea why I started getting better.

That said, I am at a point where I am very confused about my recovery trajectory, so I would like to share it here and hope to hear any useful advices or pointers. My recovery seemed to come in different rounds, and it has been the worst roller coaster ride ever. I had my first infection around March 2022, and the mild symptoms including PEM, brain fog, dysautonomia, insomnia, etc. I talked to doctors after doctors but all the advice I got is to wait. So I did wait and the symptoms did mostly clear up by Winter 2022, and I thought I was out of this mess. Unfortunately, around Feb 2023, I came back from a long trip that involved long flights and sketchy sleeping schedule, and all the symptoms came back with a vengeance. The same recovery happened and I steadily got better by the end of August. I was so happy and optimistic at this point, thinking that LC was almost behind me now. But life found another way to bring me down, and I got reinfected. This was 2 weeks ago, and since then I started experiencing PEM again. This time, interestingly, I have no brain fog, or DPDR or any of the common neurological symptoms of LC. Because of this, I'm feeling positive so far, thinking this might be a temporary set back. What do you think? Or is it just a matter of time before the whole shebang of neurological symptoms come back and wreck me.\",\n",

Consequently, both parents would fall ill from covid, ventilated, and pass on; leaving behind their two children, or their three children, or their four children, etc. These were kids in elementary school or middle school. Maybe a few just starting high school. A GoFundMe would be opened to help offset the costs of joint funeral services, but I sometimes wonder, after the donations dried up: *what happened to all those kids?* Was there a relative who could take them in? For a few, maybe. But covid was ripping through unvaccinated communities at that stage; we commonly read Facebook posts on how families lost multiple relatives and friends to pneumonia. Those children, who lost both their parents at such a precariously young age, what became of them? Where are they now? Do they blame their parents for irresponsibly pursuing selfish culture wars and petty grievances? For abandoning them when a parental figure was most needed? Or do they blame the media, the hospitals, like their predecessors? I think about them sometimes.\",\n",

We were talking about things today and I asked her if she worries about COVID or if shes only cautious because of me. She admitted that she wears a masks and tells her coworkers the reason she does is because if she gets sick she will only be down for 3-4 days but if I get sick I will be down for weeks. She recognizes that its still not a virus you should go out of your way to get, but I get the feeling that if I wasnt so sick from autoimmune disease, neurological issues, and cardiovascular and now GI issues that she probably would have stopped masking when everyone else did outside of the airport or crowded places. Idk how I feel about it from a belief system point of view. On the one hand Im happy that Im dating someone that cares about me enough to help protect me. On the other hand, I feel so alone sometimes. Even my most COVID conscious friends from 2020-2021 dont mask anymore. Sometimes I think maybe Im overreacting and its not as likely as it feels like it is to get severe health problems from getting COVID. In the back of my mind Im scared for my girlfriend to get long COVID because its going to steal so much from her. I worry that all of these people who are fine are going to start getting very sick in a few years from their mild infection. But I also feel like Im overblowing it sometimes.

It is so egotistical to still say you were right because of what you thought was right at the time, even though it was later proven wrong. And again, he said he understands science can change and is a \\\"moving target\\\". If so, doesn't that make you want to be on the side of caution? But no, let's bank on the theory that everything is totally fine. Overall, there is so much minimization going on here, and what makes this so awful is how deliberately shady he makes all of this sound.

He was in need of oxygen and got hospitalized for a week. Last week, he was transferred to another hospital which is better and he doesnt have covid anymore. However, his lungs are damaged a lot and their capacity is around 30%. He is a light smoker and smokes around a couple of cigarettes if hes having a good day which isnt often. He is eating well and talking but cant walk nor sit. Is this situation reversible? Can his lungs capacity return back to normal even with time? Pls if anyone went through something similar lmk. I understand that everyone is different but i want to know what happens after this stage. They claim that hes getting better very very slowly but idk if this includes his lungs.\",\n",

Let me explain. Yes, the amount of job listings for remote positions has declined compared to the COVID era. Why? During COVID lockdowns, the companies were forced to operate remotely! The executives and managers had to overcome their biases towards remote work. The pandemic era was an anomaly, a spike in remote markets, and we have to see it as such. The pandemic has done a lot of good for the remote job market. Before, most people have experienced the benefits and freedom of working remotely. It also tore down a lot of biases and misconceptions about working remotely. Is remote work dying? No, it's actually growing! More companies are remote-first, not just remote-friendly.

So - I had Covid almost exactly a year ago when I moved to a different country, and then caught it a second time a few months later. I have no long-term issues except that my mental health exploded during the infection (even though I wasn't even scared of Covid) and insomnia. Ever since I caught Covid, my sleep has been horrible. I attributed it all to my anxiety because my docs said it's likely from there - but I don't know if I believe that anymore. Also, does anyone have experience with opipramol / insidon?

Should I just shoot my boss an email and say oh by the way, I have this disability and I forgot to check yes, can I fix this? Thanks :)\",\n",

On my 10th day (which was this weekend), I tested negative and of course, was thrilled and tried to go about my business despite having a cough and a stuffy nose. I thought I was ok to go out unmasked and maybe the cough and stuffy nose were just some sort of residual symptoms . Today, I started to feel kind of run-down, had chills, and felt light headed, so I wondered what if it was possible that I had COVID again. I took a test and that bright red line showed up immediately. So apparently, I have rebound COVID which, according to some sources, can happem with Paxlovid. I was definitely negative this weekend, but now I'm positive again. My question is this- has anyone else had this and how long did it last? Did you have to quarantine again for a long time?\",\n",

My husband and kids were sick and didn't test (it was so mild we didn't think to) but it turned out everyone else we knew was Covid positive around that time. I assume that is what it was. The only symptom I shared with everyone was a loss of appetite. A week later I started having neurological symptoms. A trip to the ER revealed elevated ALT/ALT around 200. Had a liver/gallbladder ultrasound that was normal and hepatitis panel was normal. I had a normal CT and a *possibly* abnormal MRI that showed a subtle focal enhancement suggesting maybe MS or low grade glioma. Only one general radiologist saw this, while a second radiologist, two neurologists, a neurosurgeon saw nothing there. EBV test was negative so they don't think it's MS. I still have visual symptoms, like visual snow syndrome. The dizziness/mild vertigo I was experiencing has gotten better. It's worth nothing I had a baby 2.5 months ago and have had a hard time managing stress and anxiety since then. Not sure if that's contributing.\",\n",

While I was getting my purchases I noticed that the vaccine clinic was open yet I received no email for an appointment to date. When I had the chance to speak with the owner and chief pharmacist, he immediately took me to the head of the line to be innoculated immediately. This is due to the fact of kidney failure and dialysis. Everything went smoothly for the most part but I have a few questions that I don't know how to navigate. My first inoculation was for the flu vaccine in the left arm. Which went fine except for when I was exiting the room, I noticed that the techs/RN's were using hand sanitizer on the nitrile purple gloves that she had already used on me. She didn't change gloves between patients; just used hand sanitizer between them. In getting my covid inoculations of the booster to the left arm, it was done without any gloves and was done bare hands. This is my local pharmacy that I use as a my corner store if they are stocking what I need. They are incredibly wonderful about keeping my life sorted with all of medication and the many changes to them Im also incredibly lucky that my pharmacist fitted me in without any prior notice to the head of the line. As he wanted no delay in getting me ready to fight the coming illnesses. So my questions are should I report the flagrant disregard for cleanliness between patients? Is reusing gloves with sanitizer a big deal that should be reported or is it nothing to be worried about? And what about administrating a vaccine without gloves? Is that something that should be reported too? I am really confused and torn about the situation as they have been my only pharmacy for the past twenty years and I don't want to ruffle any feathers for nothing. So I need some perspective from others who can advise me whether I am making too much of a no brainer, or if I should rock the boat by bringing up the proper protocols for vaccine injections. I look forward to everyone's thoughts and replies to help me decide.\",\n",

She was feeling very unwell so I urged her to go to ER with the help of university dormitory office. The ER gave her new medicine and got her temperature lowered(she said her body temperature went a bit higher at the ER). 5 hours ago she texted me her temp was 103.6F, med already taken. 4 hours ago it was 104F. 2 hours ago it became 104.9F. it was midnight so I didn't respond to her. One hour ago I woke up and called the dorm office. They had a non-NP/MD check her state and said it was okay because high fever was pretty normal. From what I know if temp above 103F(especially with med taken), we should go ER. At what temp should I just call the ambulance even if school/dorm office says otherwise? Thanks.\",\n",

So I know my body is used to being a potato. But this week everything is changing. I cant say for sure, but I believe its because I bought and am using that bungee rebounder My feet dont leave the jump pad, and I have a safety handle installed on it. I just bounced gently for a few minutes several times a day, and then I rested. I am surprised and happy to say as of yet, I never had a negative reaction and am actually feeling a little joyous (which is a gift after months of not feeling any joy). Yesterday I bounced for a full 10 minutes and got my heart rate up pretty good, and then rested. No issues! I wanted to scream with happiness. And I didnt get all clammy and sweaty and feel like fainting, when last month a 15 minute walk felt like too much and would make me exhausted.\",\n",

Earlier this year, I tried setting some rules with another friend to meet (asking to get tested beforehand, meet outside, both masked in KN95s/N95s, maintaining a proper distance away from each other), but he basically ghosted me after we agreed to meet virtually. Other friends who used to text to see how I was doing have stopped and have also moved on with their lives. I would be lying if I said that their reactions haven't affected me, even though it's not their fault. Which brings me to my current dilemma: How do I respond to the couple who texted me? I would like to see them, but exposing myself to the virus is something I don't want to do. After that experience with the friend with whom I tried to set some rules before meeting, I'm hesitant to even mention anything of this sort to the couple who I stumbled upon yesterday. What rules do you have in place when socializing with others at this time? And how did you talk to your friends/family about the rules you have in place (if you do) without putting them off? If you don't have any rules in place even though you still care about not getting infected, how do you manage that?\",\n",

We have the third-highest total case counts in the country, second-highest per capita cases, and a positive test rate nearing 10%. All while our premier gives speeches that downplay the severity of COVID, refuses to onboard the national contact tracing app, and stubbornly will not enforce or put in place more restrictions to protect us from the virus. The government has scaled back testing and limited contact tracing at a critical point because they are overwhelmed. Our health minister, meanwhile, is firing health care workers and waging a war on doctors in the middle of a pandemic. PLEASE, how is this not a leading national story???\",\n",

I just got my positive result today and I've been having symptoms for 3 days, but the fever and body aches are pretty much behind me. Now I'm starting to notice some weird symptoms I wonder if anyone else has experienced. I get brain fog normally from time to time, but nothing like this. I feel oddly euphoric and cheerful but also kind of drunk. I feel downright weird. Like I'm in sort of a dream like state. I feel a very weird kind of lethargic but I also find it hard to get tired enough to fall asleep. My balance isn't 100 percent - I should definitely not operate heavy machinery. I've read about confusion in elderly people but I'm 28 and in okay shape, if that makes a difference. Has anyone else experienced symptoms like these? Also, my taste vanished today but I'm over the fever. Are there more weird symptoms to come? What kind of weird symptoms have you guys had?\",\n",

As of last night, I'm now struggling with extreme vivid and horrifying nightmares, and I've been getting wrecked with confusion all day. Been trying not to panic and get hysterical because bawling during a respiratory infection seems like a horrendous idea, but it's.... bad. Like 'trouble recognizing my partner and kids' bad. It took about 6 hours to be able to move around the house without fully freaking out and my senses are so thrown off after taking a shower that I don't even know what to do with myself. NONE of my senses are lining up and I have mad skills with acting calm in the face of chaos, but I would scream and flip the crap out if I felt well enough to do so right now. This is absolutely terrifying. Is this normal for severe covid infections??\",\n",

The main thing I'm wondering is when I am able to leave the isolation dorm, is there a number of days I'll need to stay virtual for class for? Another thing I've been curious about is on average, which day of having covid tends to mark the peak of sickness (that is, which day does one tend to feel the worst?)? I know that one's natural immunity to covid is kind of boosted after having the virus, but how likely am I to get reinfected? How helpful is eating for recovery? Is there any other actions I might want to take to help sanitize my room? I would greatly appreciate any answers y'all are able to provide, this experience is not being kind to my anxiety and I can only hope and pray my luck will be kinder to me in the future.

Another running theme was the dissonance between the actions of powerful decisionmakers (media, state and hospital officials) to delay the release of facts about the virus and the desire for families and hospital workers to access or provide care and to protect themselves. There is also coverage of COVID deniers and antimaskers in the U.S. and reactions of American healthcare workers who had treated COVID patients in 2020.

But this was the first time in five months that I'd worn a surgical for longer than 20 - 30 minutes. And for the one hour transit trip home, I realized: I hate surgical masks. The 2D rectangular shape doesn't mold well to form a seal, so I had to tighten it up with cordlocks that left blisters on the back of my ears. The mask has to be worn close against the face and forms no air pocket like a boat shaped mask or a bifold, so the material goes up your nose and into your mouth when you breathe in, stifling airflow. I finally understand how antimaskers can be born if the surgical mask is what they wear. It is awful. I made it home and threw all my surgicals to the very back of the closet and packed backup KF94 masks in my bag. I'm not confident in mask supply and don't want to throw out the 120 or so surgicals (with cordlocks and additional nose wire strips), but they are now my last-last option.\",\n",

Here's my dumb question - does that mean it's approximately as safe in our dining room as it would be if we were eating outside? Also would love to open up a conversation about CO2 monitoring in general. I also used it to test out the air filtration we were promised at work, and was happy to confirm that in my closed-door office, it stayed close to 600 ppm all day long, so obviously the CO2 I am exhaling is not building up.

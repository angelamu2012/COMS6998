      "[\"Hi everyone, I hope you can help clarify some confusion. I'm still reading headlines about how the booster is ineffective against the omicron and this makes me think that getting a booster is a kind of meaningless risk - why risk the side effects of the booster when it won't even help me? But I also think, are the other older variants (delta, original Covid) still in circulation? Maybe I should be vaccinated to protect myself against them? I don't know. I've already taken the first two doses of the vaccine <ORG>, and I took my second dose again in July 2021. I had little to any side effect. I've had enough to continue working. But I've always been afraid to receive the vaccines due to the possible side effects. I'm a 30-year-old male in normal health and normal weight.\", 'Good news from my country at last! First of all, it seems that support is growing everywhere to lift all the remaining restrictions! Many leaders in health and politics, including the hospital directors and chief epidemiologist Rll Gunason, who has been notoriously cautious throughout this time, are saying that their time to end the restrictions and it seems that this will finally be done in the coming weeks :) Second, Kri Stefnsson, doctor and founder of a genetic company that has helped enormously against COVID here is saying now that thanks to the softness of Omicrons, the extremely high rate of infection between (especially young) Icelanders and the successful vaccination program that long waits for us to be out of the pandemic phase at the beginning of April! [url] (Article - Icelandic) Obviously is not here alone but I am so happy to see all the signs that finally point to the ever increasing light at the end of the tunnel!', \"Hey guys! So my mom and I were recently hospitalized by COVID. I'm so grateful that we got home. But I'm confused. One nurse told me to wait 4 weeks to be vaccinated while another nurse told me to wait until my isolation was over. Meanwhile, I talked to my PCP and he told me to wait 3 months??? He didn't sound safe at all. He said they had natural immunity. But when I investigated the CDC, he said wait 3 months only if you were treated with antibodies or plasma. I was so confused with the different numbers. Has someone covid &amp; received your vaccine a few weeks?\", \"I had my j&amp;j a while ago, but now I want to get the <ORG> for Delta additional coverage. When I got the j&amp;j all they asked me at my local clinic was my name and date of birth and all the other personal information I could leave blank (except for medical questions as if I had been close to someone recently, etc.). My local clinic doesn't have the <ORG> so I just entered Walmart for it and they required everything including address and social security number and copy of my driving license... Definitely not happening, I don't trust Walmart. So, where can I go to get the <ORG> / MRNA shoot with minimal problems?

I've been postponing the vaccine for some time now because I work from home and spend most of the time here, or, in open areas where I feel the risk is low. However, recently, I've been seeing more stories of young people being hospitalized and wishing they would receive the vaccine. This is when my mind changed. I don't want to be a news article. I want to be here for my family. I understand that many of you may be nervous about the search for the vaccine, but you must know that it will protect them. This is not to say that there is no risk yet. I intend to keep taking care of myself and making smart decisions, however, the persistent sentence won't be weighing on me. The posts I've read here have given me peace and helped me relax.\", \"Hi, I'm fully vaccinated (since March) and I'm going to go on a weekend trip soon to D.C. through flight. This will be the first time I'm going to be leaving my bubble and potentially be around people with an unknown vaccine state.

I plan to be masked most of the time unless I'm eating, drinking, showering, etc. When will I come back, when would the optimal time to be tested? I plan to restart the bubble and quarantine before seeing loved ones with health problems.

I am fully vaccinated (it has been since March) and currently WFH. I know that if I get COVID, it will be smooth (im young, healthy and vaccinated). That said, I am not comfortable dining outdoors (having eaten in a restaurant once since March 2020), so the possibility of being inside with others scares me. Part of me wants to call this break-up and reject the job, but this is a great professional opportunity for me.

Seeking support or advice So for the past two years I have had gnarly allergies and developed chronic nasal congestion, regorging throat pain, and occasionally lack of breath. Besides that I have become chronic and since I was a child I have had symptoms of IBS so occasionally they have diarrhea. I feel like every month I have some combination of these symptoms, usually lasting 1-2 weeks per cycle. And I'm exhausted from all the paranoia around, is it coveted?? Do I have to be tested and isolated?? Do I have to waste my time being in the life of these things, am I afraid of being bored of people, am I afraid of having myself? Do I have to reveal *all* of my symptoms to everyone I find?\", 'Please don\\'t hesitate to comment here or DM me!

I scrubbed thoroughly for about 10 or 15 seconds because I was in a hurry. I had not dried my hands and some of the water was leaking into the rice that I was preparing. I microwaved the rice for 3 and a half minutes before eating it. I described this to my mother and she said that the world health organization says we don't get cooked that way.

Or about your vaccine that prevents the infection. No one.', 'There was a headline who said that the United States was \"losing the fight against COVID\" all because of the flood of the Delta. That was really depressing to read. Vaccines are certainly increasing, but I feel that it is unnecessary for the media to make headlines of that type. We have not yet lost. I find this sensationalist agenda frustrating.', \"I'm not unemployed, I don't need a job to live, and I have an offer to be in a part-time job? Everyone in my house is vaccinated, including myself. The job would be less than 20 hours a week. The employer doesn't need vaccination for employees, only that unvaccinated employees wear masks and I'm not sure how well it's being done. If I take it, of course I'll take a mask. I've been unemployed for a long time, but I'm in the incredibly privileged position where I don't need to work to live. But I really would like to have a job. I'm not doing anything right now (school, work, work at home, work as parents) and I want to contribute to the family.\", \"Since the beginning of the COVID, I've been very anxious to catch it. First it started because I didn't want to run the risk of passing anything to my parents at greater risk, but I also had to see friends lose family members to the virus. My parents ended up getting it (it didn't surprise me, considering they didn't take any precautions all that seriously). Fortunately it wasn't serious - pretty bad symptoms, but nothing that required hospitalization. Since then everyone has been vaccinated and now it doesn't seem to matter much. They're comfortable dining outdoors, seeing friends, and forgetting to wash their hands for the full 20 seconds after coming home sometimes. Meanwhile, I'm not comfortable with any of that, and I still wash my hands religiously, cleaning surfaces of high touch, etc. I've moved during the pandemic, which has helped me since I honestly don't feel safe at home (COVID-sabio). My family sometimes makes me feel bad because if we ever met for dinner, we can eat outdoors for myself.\", \"I figured I'd do a post to be one of the many people who were fully vaccinated to confirm that the vaccines are safe and that I'm fine. My first dose (March 2021) wasn't really bad except for a sore arm that went away after a day or two. The second dose had a stronger immune response, which is expected. The next day after my second dose, I woke up with a sore arm, very warm and almost fever as I felt (but not real fever only very warm body temperature), and of course a very bad headache. I was out and couldn't do anything for a day and fortunately, it was a weekend (the day after receiving my second dose), and after a day, my headache was much more manageable and it wasn't as debilitating as the previous day. Personally (speaking for myself and perhaps for others too), I would do the pandemic again if I meant putting the pandemic in the past and also to get immunity against Covid19.\", \"At this point there are people who are losing faith in the pandemic that always ends. Yes. As for when that is still in the air. However, I would not pay attention to those who say that in the United States it will be until 2023. Yes, the Delta variant is an obstacle. But the truth is that there are increasing vaccines. And next month the child vaccine is coming. I still feel that the next year in the United States will be even better than 2021 in that normality should be back, especially with more vaccines. Only because this Delta is bad does not mean that the end is no longer in sight. So please don't pay attention to the people who are predicting it will be even longer. That will only discourage you. And we don't want that.\", \"Especially in the states. Perhaps your selfishness of me, but I would love to at least travel once this year with my friends. My state has a good vaccination rate and my family, friends and I are fully vaccinated. But between delta/lambda, growing cases and children returning to school, I am hesitant to make any kind of future plans. Obviously we can't predict the future, but based on the data that there is, is it plausible that the trip will remain safe?\", 'I am someone who has suffered from OCD/Anxiety for a while, but since the VOCID-19 pandemic, my OCD &amp; Anxiety has actually climbed as I developed OCD Contamination.

I know that vaccines don't make 100% immune to the disease, but I thought the initial studies had shown that mRNA vaccines were extremely effective in preventing serious diseases, hospitalization and death (almost I mean that the initial studies suggested 100% protection against serious cases, but I might be remembering incorrectly). I've been vaccinated for quite some time, but still do little more than go out with my vaccinated friends at home.

I don't have any symptoms that are not the occasional heartbeat skipped, but reading through some of the side effects that people have experienced and seeing stories of myocarditis/pericarditis has really made me anxious.

Honestly I felt such relief after this. Not only because I proved negative, but it just really stated to me how good they work.

I could skip the backup.\", \"I hope this fits with COVID19\\\\_support, but to get to the point, COVID has recently sent my mental state into a downward spiral. The main thing that causes me anxiety is getting the vaccine because I haven't done it yet, as I constantly look at things about it and see that some of the side effects could include heart problems, GBS, or potentially blood clots and strokes. I'm a young man in the form of 20's trying to rationalize that won't happen to me but it's always an opportunity, more with COVID. I'd hate to get the vaccine and have serious or worse complications, but I also don't want to take an opportunity with COVID itself. I know it sounds pretty self absorbed but essentially this is what I'm going through. Most of my friends around me have the vaccine and its tranquilizer but I'd hate to be the one who experiences something serious. Anyone has advice about anxiety and/or maybe supporting the evidence about the rarity of these effects, what are related to vaccines?\", '...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................', \"I'm not afraid of the side effects of the booster injection, because my body tolerated the last two shots of <ORG> quite well. My second shot was hard, but most people had it hard on their second shot. I live in MA, where the cases of COVID have been rising for the last few weeks and do not show signs of peak. It's so bad here that im contemplate the reprogramming. I'm getting my injection done in a local Walgreens, since that's the most accessible place from where I live. Should I reprogram for a couple of weeks or should I go ahead and get reinforcement tomorrow?\", \"After the vaccinations, I had to leave a little test for my fiancé. He was losing his fucking mind Nothing crazy, but really start seeing the family again. Do not go back to normal, but not a prison either. We committed ourselves last September. We want to have a little engagement party. 25 people. A normal day to celebrate. We set it up by the end of January. Now the increase. So we decided to ask for a negative covet test to come. We let everyone know that please or have an app or a test at home for the RSVP date. We don't want to pay for an established number of people just to have anyone able to do a test and take the money. We also could buy a couple of additional covets at home.\", \"Hi guys, I'm totally vaccinated and I fully believe in vaccines, I'm really scared to mix them. I participated in the trials in Denmark for JJ, felt a little out for a day or two and then everything fine.. Now I don't know why I'm so anxious to get an allergic reaction to my reinforcement <ORG> that scares me to shit. As I said I completely trust the system and science but still.. Am I scared of someone with the same experience? Mixing JJ with <ORG>? Thank you very much in advance.\", \"I've heard so many people say lately that they feel like at this point we just have to learn to live with covid. But I never hear anyone explain what this means to them? Somehow I would think that the state in which we are now going back to normal but with masks and vaccines is learning to live with it. I just never know what they mean and I was curious if anyone has ideas? I'm not meaning this judgment at all I'm really curious what it looks like to people, or maybe they don't know but they're desperate for something that totally change that I get\", \"I have seen a lot of depressive and catastrophic thoughts in this sub over the past few days, so I wanted to give a more optimistic perspective. These numbers are a peak indication pretty soon within the US, and other models show that peak in action. I'm using [url] for this information. It's a really useful live database of the current diffusion of covid with data from Johns Hopkins and Yale, Harvard and Stanford backgrounds, so the information is not coming out of nowhere. And this is not just speculation about what could happen in the future, either. The NYTimes website has a covid curve tracker that can be seen without a paywall. From today (8 September), the case numbers today compared to 2 weeks ago is **1% higher.** That certainly doesn't sound exponential to me, and it's a huge sign of Delta's peak. Remember, this can't and won't be forever.\", 'Does anyone want to read about something happy about poop? Epidemiologists have learned strangely that the test of viral loads of municipal wastewater is a remarkably accurate predictor of what is going to happen to the cases, about a week before. This is proposed because this provides a complete sample that includes asymptomatic cases, those that avoid medical care or depend on unreported home tests, and can reflect viral loads. This correlation has proven to be accurate in many municipalities over the past two years and is therefore increasingly reliable. Again, a week before the cases and about two weeks before the hospitalizations, the wastewater curves predict what is going to happen. In the US there seem to be peaks and they are falling. In this article the slope seems to be falling very fast. [url] [url] More information on how and why this is done: [url]']\n"
